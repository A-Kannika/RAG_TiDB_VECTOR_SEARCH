Confidentiality ensures information is accessed only by authorized parties. Integrity ensures data is accurate and trustworthy. Availability guarantees authorized users can access information when needed.\",\n",

    "    \"Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security system that requires more than one method of verification from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity for a login or other transaction. Examples include something you know (password), something you have (phone/token), or something you are (fingerprint).\",\n",
    "    \"Firewalls act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (like the internet). They monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules, preventing unauthorized access.\",\n",
